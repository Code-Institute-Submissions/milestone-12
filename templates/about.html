         <p>The World AeroPress Championship is a global coffee-making competition, designed to find the world's best
            cup
            of AeroPress coffee.
         </p>
         <p>Each season is comprised of a series regional and national competitions, run by independent hosts across 60
            countries, which culminates with the World AeroPress Championship final.
         </p>
         <p>The competition itself is a multi-round elimination tournament. In each round, three competitors will face
            off
            against each other, simultaneously brewing a single cup of coffee using the AeroPress brewer. Competitors
            have 8 minutes in which to prepare, brew, and present their coffee to a panel of three judges.
